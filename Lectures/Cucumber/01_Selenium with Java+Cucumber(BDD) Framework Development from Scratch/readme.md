# ‚úÖ Definition:
Selenium with Java + Cucumber (BDD) is a test automation framework that integrates:
 - Selenium WebDriver (for browser automation)
 - Java (as the programming language)
 - Cucumber (for Behavior-Driven Development - BDD)</br>
 
This stack allows QA teams and developers to write test cases in plain English (Gherkin language) using Given-When-Then syntax, making them readable by non-technical stakeholders as well.
# üß© Key Features:
- Readable Test Scripts:
  - Test cases written in Gherkin syntax: Feature, Scenario, Given, When, Then.
- Separation of Concerns:
  - Business logic (in .feature files) is separated from implementation logic (step definitions in Java).
- Cross-Browser Testing:
  - Selenium WebDriver supports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.
- Supports Page Object Model (POM):
  - Promotes maintainability and reusability of test scripts.
- Maven/Gradle Integration:
  - Manage dependencies and build lifecycle easily.
- Reports & Logging:
  - Integration with plugins like ExtentReports, Allure, or Cucumber HTML reports.
- CI/CD Integration:
  - Easily integrate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.

# ‚ùå Disadvantages:
|*Disadvantage*|*Description*|
|--:|:--|
| Learning Curve | Requires understanding of Java, Selenium, Gherkin, Cucumber annotations. |
| Step Duplication Risk	| Poor structure can lead to many similar steps being re-written. |
| Slow Execution	| UI tests are slower compared to API or unit tests. |
| Requires Good Practices |	Without POM and tagging, the project can become unmanageable. |
