# What is `Rest Assured`?
***Rest Assured*** is a Java-based library used for testing RESTful APIs. It simplifies the process of writing HTTP requests and validating responses, so you can easily perform operations like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more—without needing to write boilerplate HTTP code.
Think of it as a way to automate API testing using Java, with a clean syntax that’s similar to how you'd write test scenarios in plain English.
